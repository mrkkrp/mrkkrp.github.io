      <p>Hi, my name is Mark Karpov. You can send me an email to markkarpov at opmbx dot org. I’m trying to keep my digital life minimal, so I have <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp">GitHub account here</a>, but no Twitter or social net account. I’m also (unsuccessfully) trying to limit amount of time I spend with computers.</p>
<p>Apart from programming I’m interested in Russian underground music and generative (algorithmic) music, potential of which is still to be discovered (IMO) by popular music industry.</p>
<p>If you need a Haskell hacker, I’m interested in offers. Résumé in English and Russian is available on request. If your business is located in Russia, it’s perfect, otherwise I can work remotely. Relocation is not possible, since I have my own long-term aims connected with Russia and its future and I need to be where I am to achieve them.</p>
