<p><strong>There must be a reason why Lisp sucks so badly.</strong> I think the reason is the community. Lisp attracts megalomaniacs, lone hackers who hack for themselves, not for the benefit of the community. Thus these people are not going to appreciate work of others because there is a lot of that Lisp junk already produced by <del>them</del> previous generations of Lispers. They are not going to document properly their code because the code is a hack, not something to be consumed by self-respecting fellow hackers.</p>
<p><strong>Lisp is not going anywhere.</strong> <em>Haskell</em> is constantly improving at such a speed that it’s difficult to keep track of all the developments. <em>Common Lisp</em> sits with its standard frozen decades ago with no proper libraries written (<em>proper</em> means: maintained, tested, documented) and fragmentation increasing.</p>
<p><strong>Lisp is unsafe</strong> and in addition to that it’s poorly tested. Even Quicklisp does not have tests. “Why have tests? They take time to write, we can just hack it together and put it out.” Of course you can, you always do, Lispers. If you wanted to build something reliable you would choose a language with strong type system to begin with.</p>
<p>It’s amazing <strong>how loose Lisp projects look compared to something like good libraries in C</strong>. C has to have discipline. C libraries are well documented and clear, you can feel discipline and aim behind them. Lisp does not demonstrate this in 95% of cases, it much prefers to suck rocks.</p>
<p>So if you think whether or not to learn Lisp, <strong>save your time and pick a better modern language</strong> like Haskell or Rust. If it must be a Lisp, and Java doesn’t make you vomit, try Clojure.</p>
