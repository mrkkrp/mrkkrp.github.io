<p>A month and a half has passed from the moment when I switched to the Dvorak keyboard layout. You can find out a lot of blog posts and descriptions of how the layout is better (<a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~shipman/ergo/parkinson.html">this</a> is my favorite). I’m telling you now: it’s really better in every way, it’s not just a thing for geeks to show-off as some people say, it’s a real performance and comfort booster.</p>
<p>The first several days is a nightmare. If you type every day, be prepared to get significant performance drop. Even one sentence feels like a real torture, you need to control your hands “manually” — no unconscious magic from your brain to assist you during this time. I personally just got a glimpse how much of background work our brain normally does. When I started to learn Dvorak, I had to type at least a bit every day, and it often gave me headaches because of enormous conscious effort that typing required.</p>
<p>After a week I got to speed of 25–30 wpm (I switched cold turkey and never attempted using QWERTY once I started with Dvorak). I think getting this speed would take longer for most people, but I type a lot and I really tried to type as much as I can during that first week. After one week you can do some programming. (And yes, I had to re-learn Emacs shortcuts and re-arrange my <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/modalka">custom modal system</a> a bit because I decided not to use input-methods but to set Dvorak on OS level.) Basically, at this stage you’re just slow, but Dvorak already feels better.</p>
<p>After a month I got to my previous speed 60 wpm. This was my top speed with QWERTY — when I really tried to type fast, that’s what I got. I thought that I won’t be able to ever beat this personal record. Well, I have to say yes, not with QWERTY. Now, after another 15 days I type 70 wpm and I feel like I will be able to do 80 and maybe 100 someday.</p>
<p>But main thing about Dvorak is comfort, of course. It just feels so much better. You know, like proper mechanical keyboard feels better. Like modal editing feels better than non-modal. Hands move so natural and with surprising accuracy, text just flows… Now combination of modal editing and Dvorak has eliminated any discomfort for me even when I use laptop keyboard. I can type a lot and I cannot reach the point when my hands are tired. Old weird sensations in my hands have gone. Now I just see how <em>proper</em> touch typing is done.</p>
