Hi, my name is Mark Karpov. You can send me an email to markkarpov at opmbx
dot org. I'm trying to keep my digital life minimal, so I have
[GitHub account here](https://github.com/mrkkrp), but no Twitter or social
net account. I'm also (unsuccessfully) trying to limit amount of time I
spend with computers.

Apart from programming I'm interested in Russian underground music and
generative (algorithmic) music, potential of which is still to be discovered
(IMO) by popular music industry.

If you need a Haskell hacker, I'm interested in offers. Résumé in English
and Russian is available on request. If your business is located in Russia,
it's perfect, otherwise I can work remotely. Relocation is not possible,
since I have my own long-term aims connected with Russia and its future and
I need to be where I am to achieve them.
