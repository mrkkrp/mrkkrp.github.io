Hi, my name is Mark Karpov. You can send me an email to markkarpov at opmbx
dot org. I'm trying to keep my digital life minimal, so I
have [GitHub account here](https://github.com/mrkkrp), but no Twitter or
social net account.

Apart from programming I'm interested in Russian underground music and
generative (algorithmic) music, potential of which is still to be discovered
(IMO) by popular music industry.

I currently work full time as a Haskell Developer
for [Stack Builders](https://stackbuilders.com) where I write Haskell
tutorials, blog posts, and solve real-world problems for our clients using
this wonderful language.
